Hi, 

I am Yingjie Hu (Iris, or YJH), a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics in New York University. This website provides videos that compare Chinese Hanzi and Japanese Kanji. It is interesting to show similarities and differences between Chinese and Japanese from a historical perspective. I hope you will enjoy the videos.
